Bowen: What are each team's plan for this sprint?

Pace B: Get the environment set up, and work on some tutorial to get the team warmed up.
Bowen: What environment are you working with?
Pace B: NodeJS, React, and Firebase.
Bowen: Remember to make an exploration issue on github when getting the environment set up and when working on the tutorials. What are the other teams working on this sprint?
Pace C: Pretty much the same thing, the idea is to get set up.
Bowen: And what environment are you working with?
Pace C: Same as Pace B.
Pace A: And we have the same idea, get everything running on the local environments for each of our team member’s computers and do some basic tests to make sure it’s working correctly. And we are working with Node, React and PostgreSQL.
Bowen: So everyone is working with Node and React, two teams with Firebase, and one with Postgre?
Various people: yes.
Bowen: Ok, sounds good, anyone else have any questions?
Pace C: *asks some specific question for their team*
Bowen: *answers*
Bowen: I’m going to go talk to the other teams and I’ll see you next week.
